## Performance Analysis

### Key Observations

- **Model Size**: int4 provides the most compact model
- **Inference Speed**: fp16 offers the fastest inference
- **Memory Efficiency**: int4 uses the least GPU memory
- **Code Generation**: fp16 performs best on the HumanEval benchmark

### Trade-offs

- Lower precision quantization (e.g., int4) generally results in smaller model size and lower memory usage, but may impact performance on certain tasks.
- Higher precision formats maintain more of the original model's capabilities but require more resources.
- The optimal quantization method depends on the specific deployment constraints and performance requirements.

## Conclusion

Based on the benchmarking results, we can make the following recommendations:

- **Best Overall Balance**: fp16 provides the best balance between model size, inference speed, and HumanEval performance.
- **For Resource-Constrained Environments**: int4 is recommended due to its minimal size and memory footprint.
- **For Performance-Critical Applications**: fp16 maintains the highest code generation accuracy.
- **For Latency-Sensitive Applications**: fp16 offers the fastest response times.
