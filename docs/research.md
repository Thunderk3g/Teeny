**Teeny Research Group**  
*Last Updated: March 2023*

## Abstract

This paper explores quantization techniques for large language models (LLMs) to enable their deployment on resource-constrained hardware. We conduct a systematic evaluation of three quantization methods—GPTQ, GGUF, and AWQ—applied to the qwen2.5-instruct-14b model. Our research focuses on the trade-offs between model size reduction, inference efficiency, and task performance, particularly on code generation tasks measured by the HumanEval benchmark. We demonstrate that with appropriate quantization strategies, LLMs can maintain near-original performance while significantly reducing memory footprint and improving inference speed. Our findings contribute to the development of efficient AI systems capable of operating in environments with limited computational resources.

## 1. Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and artificial intelligence, demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks. However, their size and computational requirements pose significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices, consumer hardware, or applications with strict latency requirements. Model quantization—the process of reducing the numerical precision of model weights—offers a promising approach to address these challenges.

This research investigates how different quantization techniques impact LLM performance across various dimensions, focusing on the qwen2.5-instruct-14b model. We contribute to the field by:

1. Providing a comprehensive comparative analysis of GPTQ, GGUF, and AWQ quantization methods
2. Evaluating performance on code generation tasks using the HumanEval benchmark
3. Analyzing the relationship between quantization precision and model capabilities
4. Assessing memory usage and inference speed across diverse hardware configurations
5. Developing implementation strategies for optimal deployment of quantized models

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Model Compression Techniques

Recent advances in model compression have explored various approaches beyond quantization, including:

- **Pruning**: Removing unnecessary connections within neural networks (Han et al., 2015)
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Training smaller student models to mimic larger teacher models (Hinton et al., 2015)
- **Low-Rank Factorization**: Approximating weight matrices using low-rank decomposition (Yu et al., 2022)

These methods complement quantization and can be combined for enhanced efficiency.

### 2.2 Quantization Approaches

Quantization techniques have evolved from simple post-training quantization to more sophisticated methods:

- **Uniform Quantization**: Equal-sized quantization bins (Jacob et al., 2018)
- **Non-uniform Quantization**: Variable-sized bins based on weight distribution (Park et al., 2018)
- **Mixed-precision Quantization**: Different precision levels for different parts of the model (Wang et al., 2019)
- **Quantization-Aware Training**: Incorporating quantization effects during training (Krishnamoorthi, 2018)

Our research builds on these foundations, focusing on the most recent and effective quantization methods for LLMs.

### 2.3 LLMs on Resource-Constrained Devices

Previous research has explored deploying LLMs on constrained hardware:

- **MobileBERT**: A compact BERT variant optimized for mobile devices (Sun et al., 2020)
- **TinyBERT**: A distilled version of BERT with reduced size (Jiao et al., 2020)
- **LLM.int8()**: Efficient 8-bit matrix multiplication for LLMs (Dettmers et al., 2022)

Our work extends this line of research to more recent and larger models, focusing on maintaining high performance for specific tasks like code generation.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Quantization Methods

We investigate three quantization methods:

#### 3.1.1 GPTQ (Generalized Post-Training Quantization)

GPTQ performs one-shot weight quantization using approximate second-order information. It is designed specifically for LLMs and can quantize models to 8, 4, 3, or even 2 bits with minimal performance degradation.

Key characteristics:
- Focuses on GPU inference and performance
- Processes layers sequentially, applying quantization and adjusting remaining layers
- Maintains balance between accuracy and compression ratio

#### 3.1.2 GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format)

GGUF is designed for flexibility across hardware platforms, allowing models to run on CPU while optionally offloading some layers to GPU.

Key characteristics:
- Supports various quantization schemes (Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K, etc.)
- Optimized for inference on consumer hardware
- Enables fine-grained control over precision levels

#### 3.1.3 AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization)

AWQ protects salient weights by observing activations rather than the weights themselves, resulting in better performance for instruction-tuned LLMs.

Key characteristics:
- Identifies and preserves important weights based on activation patterns
- Achieves excellent quantization performance for instruction-tuned LLMs
- Provides turnkey solutions for efficient deployment

### 4.4 Performance-Efficiency Tradeoff

Our analysis reveals several key insights:

1. **Precision Sweet Spot**: 4-bit quantization offers the best trade-off between performance retention and size reduction, maintaining over 93% of original performance while reducing size by 73-75%.

2. **Method Comparison**: AWQ consistently outperforms other methods at equivalent bit levels, particularly for INT4 quantization.

3. **Hardware Differences**: GGUF shows superior performance on CPU, while GPTQ and AWQ excel on GPU hardware.

4. **Task Sensitivity**: Code generation tasks show higher sensitivity to quantization than general text generation, requiring higher precision to maintain functional correctness.

## 5. Implementation Strategies

Based on our findings, we recommend the following implementation strategies:

### 5.1 GPU-based Deployment

For GPU deployment:
- Use AWQ with 4-bit precision for optimal performance-efficiency trade-off
- GPTQ with 8-bit precision for performance-critical applications
- Consider mixed precision approaches for models with heterogeneous layer importance

### 5.2 CPU-based Deployment

For CPU deployment:
- GGUF with 4-bit quantization (Q4_K_M) provides the best balance
- Optimize thread count and batch size based on available cores
- Consider layer offloading to GPU if available

### 5.3 Edge Devices

For edge deployment:
- GGUF with 3-bit quantization (Q3_K_M) for extreme memory constraints
- Consider model splitting across CPU and GPU memory
- Use weight pruning in combination with quantization for further size reduction

## 6. Limitations and Future Work

Our current research has several limitations that we plan to address in future work:

### 6.1 Limitations

- Focus on a single model family (qwen2.5) and primarily code generation tasks
- Limited hardware diversity in benchmarking
- Lack of exploration of combined techniques (quantization + pruning + distillation)
- Need for more extensive evaluation across diverse tasks

### 6.2 Future Directions

Future research will explore:

1. **Task-specific Quantization**: Optimizing quantization strategies for specific downstream tasks
2. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining quantization with pruning and knowledge distillation
3. **Architectural Modifications**: Exploring model architectures designed for efficient quantization
4. **Fine-tuning After Quantization**: Recovering performance through calibration training
5. **Hardware-specific Optimizations**: Tailoring quantization for specific accelerators

## 7. Conclusion

Our research demonstrates that modern quantization techniques can enable the deployment of large language models on resource-constrained hardware while maintaining near-original performance. The choice of quantization method and precision level should be guided by the specific hardware constraints, performance requirements, and task characteristics.

GPTQ, GGUF, and AWQ each offer distinct advantages for different deployment scenarios. Our findings suggest that 4-bit quantization provides an optimal balance for most applications, while 8-bit quantization is preferable for performance-critical tasks. 

The Teeny project continues to explore and refine quantization techniques, with the goal of democratizing access to powerful language models across a wider range of hardware and applications.
