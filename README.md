# LLM Quantization Research

This repository contains research code and documentation for investigating and benchmarking quantization techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Overview

LLM quantization reduces the precision of model weights and activations to decrease model size and computational requirements while attempting to maintain performance. This repository provides tools and resources for quantizing, benchmarking, and analyzing different quantization methods.

## Repository Structure

- `quantize_llm.py`: Main script for quantizing models using various methods (GPTQ, AWQ, Int8, FP16)
- `visualize_quantization.py`: Script for creating visualizations of quantization results
- `quantization_research.md`: Comprehensive overview of quantization techniques and research findings
- `benchmark_results/`: Directory containing benchmark results for different models and methods
- `visualization_results/`: Directory containing visualized comparisons and metrics

## Quantization Methods

This repository supports multiple quantization methods:

1. **GPTQ** (Generative Pre-trained Transformer Quantization)
   - One-shot weight quantization using second-order information
   - Supports 2-4 bit precision with minimal accuracy loss
   - Uses the `auto-gptq` library

2. **AWQ** (Activation-aware Weight Quantization)
   - Preserves weights with the most impact on activations
   - Excellent performance at 4-bit precision
   - Uses the `awq` library

3. **GGUF** (formerly GGML)
   - File format for efficient inference on consumer hardware
   - Compatible with llama.cpp ecosystem
   - Multiple quantization levels (2-8 bits)

4. **Int8/FP16 Quantization**
   - Standard 8-bit integer and 16-bit floating point quantization
   - Widely supported across frameworks and hardware
   - Implemented via HuggingFace's transformers and bitsandbytes

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantization-research.git
cd quantization-research

# Create a conda environment
conda create -n quant_env python=3.10
conda activate quant_env

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quantizing a Model

```bash
# Basic Int8 quantization
python quantize_llm.py --model_id "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct" --method int8 --benchmark

# 4-bit GPTQ quantization with benchmarking
python quantize_llm.py --model_id "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct" --method gptq --bits 4 --benchmark

# 4-bit AWQ quantization
python quantize_llm.py --model_id "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct" --method awq --bits 4 --benchmark --humaneval
```

### Visualizing Results

```bash
# Generate visualizations for all benchmark results
python visualize_quantization.py --results_dir "./quantized_models" --output_dir "./visualization_results"

# Compare only quantization methods
python visualize_quantization.py --comparison_type methods
```

## Benchmark Metrics

The benchmarking system collects the following metrics:

- **Model Size**: Disk space required by the quantized model
- **Memory Usage**: RAM consumption during inference
- **Inference Speed**: Tokens generated per second
- **Generation Time**: Average time to generate a response
- **HumanEval Performance**: Code generation capabilities (optional)

## Example Results

Below are sample results for different quantization methods applied to the Qwen 7B model:

| Method | Model Size | Memory Usage | Tokens/sec | HumanEval Pass@1 |
|--------|------------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| Original | 14.7 GB | 19.3 GB | 5.2 | 23.7% |
| FP16 | 7.3 GB | 9.8 GB | 6.1 | 23.5% |
| Int8 | 3.7 GB | 5.1 GB | 9.8 | 22.9% |
| GPTQ (4-bit) | 1.8 GB | 2.6 GB | 14.5 | 21.2% |
| AWQ (4-bit) | 1.9 GB | 2.8 GB | 16.2 | 22.1% |

## Research Insights

Key findings from our research:

1. **4-bit quantization** provides the best balance of model size reduction and performance
2. **AWQ** generally outperforms GPTQ in inference speed while maintaining better accuracy
3. **Symmetric quantization** works better for weight matrices, while asymmetric quantization is preferred for activations
4. **Per-group quantization** (with group size of 128) offers a good trade-off between accuracy and memory overhead
