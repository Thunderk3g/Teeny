# LLM Quantization Research

## Introduction

This document provides an organized overview of quantization techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs). Quantization is a model compression technique that reduces the precision of model weights and activations, significantly decreasing model size and computational requirements while attempting to maintain model performance.

## Quantization Methods Comparison

### GPTQ
GPTQ (Generative Pre-trained Transformer Quantization) is a one-shot weight quantization method specifically designed for transformer models.

- **Key Features**:
  - Uses second-order information (Hessian matrix) to determine optimal quantization
  - Applies quantization layer-by-layer in a single pass
  - Supports extremely low bit-widths (2-4 bits)
  - Minimal accuracy loss compared to other methods
  
- **Implementation**: Uses the `auto-gptq` library
- **Best Use Case**: When minimum model size is critical

### GGUF
GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) is a file format for quantized models that evolved from GGML.

- **Key Features**:
  - Designed for inference efficiency
  - Compatible with llama.cpp ecosystem
  - Various quantization levels (from 2-bit to 8-bit)
  - Supports different quantization schemes (Q4_K, Q5_K, etc.)
  
- **Implementation**: Converted using llama.cpp tools
- **Best Use Case**: Deployment on consumer hardware or mobile devices

### AWQ
AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) focuses on preserving the most important weights based on activation patterns.

- **Key Features**:
  - Identifies and preserves weights that have the most impact on activations
  - Applies different quantization strategies based on weight importance
  - Offers exceptional performance at 4-bit precision
  - Faster inference than GPTQ in many cases
  
- **Implementation**: Uses the `awq` library
- **Best Use Case**: When balancing accuracy and speed is critical

## Quantization Precision Formats

### Float16 (FP16)
Half-precision floating point format using 16 bits.

- **Structure**: 1 sign bit, 5 exponent bits, 10 mantissa bits
- **Range**: Approximately 6.0 × 10^−8 to 6.5 × 10^4
- **Memory Savings**: 50% compared to FP32
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal degradation for most tasks
- **Hardware Support**: Widely supported on modern GPUs

### Int8
8-bit integer quantization.

- **Structure**: 8-bit signed or unsigned integers
- **Range**: -128 to 127 (signed) or 0 to 255 (unsigned)
- **Memory Savings**: 75% compared to FP32
- **Performance Impact**: Moderate, but acceptable for many applications
- **Hardware Support**: Excellent, including on CPUs and mobile devices

### Int4
4-bit integer quantization.

- **Structure**: 4-bit signed or unsigned integers
- **Range**: -8 to 7 (signed) or 0 to 15 (unsigned)
- **Memory Savings**: 87.5% compared to FP32
- **Performance Impact**: Significant, requires careful implementation
- **Hardware Support**: Limited, but growing with specialized hardware

## Quantization Schemes

### Symmetric Quantization
Maps floating-point values symmetrically around zero.

- **Formula**: `q = round(x / scale)`
- **Dequantization**: `x = q * scale`
- **Advantages**: Simpler, no zero-point required
- **Limitations**: Less efficient for asymmetric distributions

### Asymmetric Quantization
Uses both a scale and zero-point to map floating-point values.

- **Formula**: `q = round(x / scale) + zero_point`
- **Dequantization**: `x = (q - zero_point) * scale`
- **Advantages**: Better representation for non-zero-centered distributions
- **Limitations**: More complex, requires additional zero-point operations

## Quantization Granularity

### Per-Tensor Quantization
Applies the same quantization parameters across an entire tensor.

- **Advantages**: Simple, memory-efficient
- **Limitations**: Less accurate for tensors with varying ranges

### Per-Channel Quantization
Applies different quantization parameters for each channel/dimension.

- **Advantages**: Higher accuracy, especially for convolutional layers
- **Limitations**: Requires more memory for storing quantization parameters

### Per-Group Quantization
Applies quantization to groups of channels/neurons.

- **Advantages**: Balance between accuracy and parameter overhead
- **Implementation**: Common in GPTQ (group size of 128)

## Calibration Methods

### Zero-Shot Quantization
Quantizes without any calibration data.

- **Advantages**: Simplest approach, no data required
- **Limitations**: Generally lower accuracy

### Representative Dataset Calibration
Uses a small dataset to determine optimal quantization parameters.

- **Advantages**: Better accuracy than zero-shot
- **Limitations**: Requires representative data

### Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
Simulates quantization during fine-tuning to adapt the model.

- **Advantages**: Highest accuracy
- **Limitations**: Computationally expensive, requires full training setup

## Model Pruning and Quantization

Pruning removes unnecessary weights before quantization for further compression.

### Unstructured Pruning
- Removes individual weights based on magnitude or importance
- Can be combined with quantization for additional compression
- Typically requires retraining after pruning

### Structured Pruning
- Removes entire structures (neurons, attention heads)
- More hardware-friendly than unstructured pruning
- Example: SparseGPT, which combines pruning with quantization
